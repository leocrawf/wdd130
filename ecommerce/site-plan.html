        <p class="care-child-2">
          Do you love plants, but find that gardening stresses you out? Do you
          cringe every time someone hands you a plant and tell them you’re “sure
          to kill it within a week?” Do you envy the green thumbs of your
          neighbors, friends and relatives, while struggling to keep even one
          houseplant yourself?
          <br /><br />
          If this sounds like you, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
          Plenty of people struggle to keep plants alive at first, but with
          time, practice and a little instruction, anyone can learn to do it.
          Just because it isn’t something that comes naturally to you doesn’t
          mean you have to accept that you’ll never be able to do it.
          <br /><br />
          Keeping potted plants alive is a learned skill, and there is no reason
          you can’t learn to do it, too. To help you out and get you started on
          your plant-care journey, we’ve put together this tutorial on
          everything you need to know about how to take care of potted plants.
          By the time we’re finished here, you’ll be ready to put these skills
          into practice. So grab your gardening gloves and potting soil and
          let’s get started.
        </p>

        <h3 class="care-child-4">Tips to Keep Potted Houseplants Alive</h3>

        <p class="care-child-5">
          While the rules for all plants are fairly similar, they will differ
          slightly depending on the environment your plant is going to be living
          in. If you’re mostly wondering how to take care of potted indoor
          plants, then this is the section for you. Here are our best tips to
          keep houseplants alive:<br /><br />
          <b>1. Choose the Correct Pot</b>
          <br />
          Drainage is extremely important for your plant. Ideally, a pot should
          have a hole in the bottom so that excess water can drain out of the
          soil and collect in a tray underneath the pot. If there is no such
          hole, all the extra water is trapped in the soil. Often, this is more
          water than the plant can successfully absorb, and this will result in
          a plant “drowning.” If you notice your plant looks wilted and droopy,
          but the soil is still damp, the odds are good that you have a drainage
          problem, and the plant is too wet.
          <br /><br />
          In the same way, plants need plenty of space to grow. If the roots run
          out of room to stretch out, the plant will become top-heavy, and the
          roots won’t be able to support the amount of foliage on your plant.
          This will cause it to wither and die.
          <br /><br />
          While it’s easiest to simply leave the plant in the pot or basket you
          got it in, this isn’t always the best way to keep your plant healthy
          and strong. For your plant to stay healthy, it needs to be in a pot
          that gives it room to grow and stretch its roots. It will also require
          a pot that allows for adequate drainage.
          <br /><br />
          <b>2. Use Good Potting Soil</b>
          <br />
          If you’re re-potting your houseplant from the container it came in and
          putting it in a better pot, you’ll also need to think about what type
          of potting soil you’re using. It isn’t enough to just scoop some dirt
          out of your backyard. Instead, buy a bag of potting soil. These mixes
          often contain extra nutrients or fertilizers that will help your
          houseplant stay strong and healthy.
          <br /><br />
          Depending on what type of plant you’re working with, you may be able
          to find a potting mix designed specifically for that species. If
          you’re planting a cactus or succulent, for example, there are often
          potting soils that are crafted with just the right nutrients for these
          types of plants.
          <br /><br />
          <b>3. Watering: Not Too Much and Not Too Little</b>
          <br />
          Watering can be a little bit tricky, especially if you’re new to plant
          care. Water too much, and your plant can easily drown. Water too
          little, and the plant will dry up and die. For happy and healthy
          plants, you’ll need to find a delicate balance between these two
          extremes. While some plants prefer to live in moist soil, the vast
          majority of plants do best when you allow the soil to dry out between
          watering.
          <br /><br />
          To tell whether or not your plant needs water, feel the soil,
          preferably near the edge of the pot. If the dirt feels dry and
          crumbly, it’s time to water. If it still feels damp, it probably
          doesn’t need more just yet. After a few weeks of this practice, you
          should begin to get the hang of knowing when your plants need water.
          <br /><br />
          Of course, you’ll also be able to tell if your plants are dying of
          thirst. If you notice the leaves are turning dry, brown and shriveled,
          your plant is in desperate need of water. Hopefully, however, you’ll
          water your plant long before it gets to this point.
          <br /><br />
          When giving your plant a drink, water it until the water begins to run
          out the hole in the bottom of the pot, or until the soil no longer
          absorbs any water. If the water begins to pool on top of the soil
          refusing to soak in any more, then it’s time to stop watering.
          <br /><br />
          It’s difficult to prescribe exactly how often you should water your
          plant because every plant and every plant species is different. You
          can read up on your specific plant to gain more information, but in
          general, it’s better to let your plant tell you when it needs water.
          Learn to read the soil and the leaves of a plant, and recognize when
          it’s asking you for some water.
          <br /><br />
          <b>4. Give Them Plenty of Light</b>
          <br />
          While every plant has different preferences in terms of shade versus
          sun, no plant will grow with absolutely no light whatsoever. If you
          put your plant in the closet, high on a dark shelf or backed into a
          shadowy corner, it is not going to do well.
          <br /><br />
          Your plant needs at least some sun to thrive. For this reason,
          windowsills are great places to put plants. If you don’t have a
          windowsill large enough, though, there are other options. Put them on
          a table or a cart in front of a window, or in some place that
          experiences plenty of sunlight.

          <br /><br />
          <b>5. Keep Your Pet Away</b>
          <br />
          This should go without saying, but it’s something you might not have
          thought of if you’re new to houseplants. Animals may love your plants,
          but unfortunately, this often translates into loving them to death.
          Specifically, your pet might eat your plant, or tear it up in their
          enthusiasm.
          <br /><br />
          To fix this problem, try placing your houseplants in places your pet
          can’t access. Maybe put them high up on the counter, or on top of a
          cabinet. Just be sure to balance the need to keep the plant out of
          harm’s way with the need to place it in an area that still gets sun.
          <br /><br />
          Another thing to note is that there are a variety of poisonous plants
          to animals, so there is some extra incentive to keep plants and pets
          separate.
          <br /><br />
          <b>6. Learn About Your Plant</b>
          <br />
          This is a fundamental rule of plant care whether you’re dealing with
          indoor houseplants, hanging outdoor baskets, garden plants or
          something else altogether. Take the time to learn about the type of
          plant you’re caring for. Learn how much sun it likes, or how much
          shade. Learn if it needs to be watered every day, or if it can go as
          long as two weeks without water.
          <br /><br />
          Every plant has its own unique set of requirements. While there are
          plenty of across-the-board rules that apply to most plants, you will
          have the best results and the greatest rate of success when you take
          the time to learn about each species of plant individually.
